In order to set up the custom-colored Google Map, I will need you to create a Google API key.

Here's how that's done:

Pick a Google/gmail account you are comfortable using for this purpose. 
Login and follow these directions to set up a project and enable billing. (You will only be billed if the project exceeds its free quota.) 
Directions for setting up an API key are here. You will need to enable the following: Maps JavaScript API, Geocoding API and Places API.

I can't do steps 1 & 2, but I'm happy to pick up #3 if you'd prefer! Please call me at 216-282-6662 and leave a message with the Gmail login.
